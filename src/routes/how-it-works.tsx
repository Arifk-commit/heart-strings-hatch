This modest fee covers comprehensive veterinary examinations, core vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, deworming, and microchip registration. You receive a pet with medical investments often exceeding ₹15,000 in private clinic costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I adopt if I live in an apartment or rent my home?",
    a: "Yes, absolutely! Many dogs, cats, and small animals thrive in apartments. What matters most is providing daily exercise, mental enrichment, and love. We recommend checking your landlord or building pet policy before applying.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I already have other pets at home?",
    a: "We actively screen and tag pets that are friendly with other dogs, cats, or small animals. During Step 3 (Meet & Greet), we coordinate structured animal introductions to ensure existing pets and newcomers feel safe and comfortable together.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the entire adoption process take?",
    a: "Typically between 2 to 5 business days from your first application to adoption day. This gives enough time for application review, a relaxing meet-and-greet, and home preparation without unnecessary delays.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 3-3-3 rule for adopted pets?",
    a: "The 3-3-3 guideline describes your pet's adjustment phases: The first 3 days they may feel overwhelmed or shy and need quiet space. In 3 weeks, they understand your daily routine and show their true personality. By 3 months, they feel secure, trusting, and fully at home.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the pet is not the right fit for my family?",
    a: "While our thorough matching process results in a 98% forever placement rate, life happens. In the rare event an adoption doesn't work out, our partner rescues provide a safe return policy to ensure the animal is never abandoned.",

  {
    q: "Can first-time pet owners adopt through PawConnect?",
